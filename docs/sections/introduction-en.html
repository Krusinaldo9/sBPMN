<p>
The <strong>sBPMN ontology</strong> provides a semantic representation of business processes modeled using the <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/" target="_blank">BPMN 2.0</a> standard. It enables the transformation of BPMN process models into expressive and interoperable knowledge graphs that can be used for semantic querying, explainability, and process monitoring.
</p>

<p>
The ontology is organized into two aligned modules:
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>sbpmnc</code></strong> defines the BPMN classes.</li>
  <li><strong><code>sbpmnp</code></strong> defines the properties used to assert process-specific facts.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This separation reflects the structure of the official BPMN 2.0 XML schema, where elements and attributes may share the same local name but differ in their syntactic role. By mirroring this distinction in OWL, sBPMN ensures semantic compatibility with existing BPMN tools while enabling ontology-based reasoning and validation.
</p>

<p>
The combined use of <code>sbpmnc</code> and <code>sbpmnp</code> allows for the representation of both the static structure of process models and the dynamic aspects of their execution. This enables integration with runtime logs and external data sources, as well as support for federated queries over hybrid knowledge graphs.
